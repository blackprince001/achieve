# Achieve

### What does this API do?
It's supposed to "mimic" how the [Achieve Investment App](https://theachieveapp.com/) works.

Inspired by Griffith's [Cashapp API](https://github.com/gwuah/cashapp).

### Features
- Create investment "wallets" (Investment Accounts or Investment Goals)
- Top up your wallets
- Withdraw from your wallets

More features may be added as time goes on. These are the ones in mind currently.
